class Map:
    """
    A map is a dynamic data structure.
    A map contains a set of Points that are contained within its borders.
    The Map will contain the call to the solving algorithm.
    The Map will be able to export data in a presentable manner for the UI.
    (CONSIDER) The greater Map will be composed by multiple smaller Maps so that we can work in chunks based on zoom in.
